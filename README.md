This is an exploration/demo app for some Node.js stuff I currently care about: 
- Streams as units of data processing
- Subtack's Seaport module
- Also Substack's Fleet module
- TypeScript

What is does: track planes. It's planned to attach a radar antenna, feed the data stream into the app, run it into a database for aggregation, and have some visualization/predictions on a web client. Also, I want the antenna part to run on a Raspberry Pi.

Let's see how far this gets.
